[P]: Proof

Section 1: Algebra of Semirings

  [D]: Monoid
  [D]: Semiring
  [D]: Homorphism and algebra

  [D]: Module
  [D]: Flat module/algebra

  [D]: Category of R algebras
  [T]: (Co)completeness of Alg_R

Section 2: Geometry of Semirings

  [D]: Affine N-scheme
  [D]: Topology(-ies)
  [D]: Category/site/topos of Affine N-schemes

  [D]: Locally trivial schemes i.e. Finite etale morphisms
  [E]: Booleans are simply connected
  [D]: Category of locally trivial morphisms FEtx
  [T]: FEtx is a Boolean Topos

  [D]: Geometric point
  [E]: Separably closed fields and Booleans
  [T]: Pull back from FEtx to point is exact and reflects isomorphisms

Section 3: Galois Category

  [D]: Define Galois with Grothendieck's axioms.
  [D]: Alternative definition in Johnstone: Boolean Topos + exact/refl functor
  [T]: FEtx + point is Galois
    [P]: Topos (Johnstone) with reference to previous section
    [P]: Rob/Grothendieck/Lenstra/Milne. Point to: thesis, SGA1, and lenstra notes
    [P]: (Co)Monadic
  [E]: X = Spec(k) for k a field
  [R]: Compare this theory to Artin-Galois theory
  [E]: X = Spec(R) for R a ring
  [E]: Booleans

Section 4: Non-negative reals and real number fields

  [T]: R_+ are simply connected
  [T]: For each real point p E_p,+ and E_++ are simply connected

Section 5: Natural numbers

  [T]: Natural numbers are simply connected

Section 6: Jim's Etale Quadratic Extensions

  [R]: Motivation from group actions on plane.
        Obivious diagonal definition doesn't work.
        Follow nose to get "poor man's" diagonal.
        Result has B point, therefore not a ring.
        No idempotents, so connected.
  [T]: R above is **not** simply connected

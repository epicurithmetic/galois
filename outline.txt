Section 0: Introduction with a nice story

Section 1: Algebra of Semirings

  [X][D]: Monoid
  [X][D]: Semiring
  [X][D]: Homomorphism and algebra

  [X][D]: Module
  [ ][D]: Flat module/algebra

  [ ][D]: Category of R algebras
  [ ][T]: (Co)completeness of Alg_R


Section 2: Geometry of Semirings

  [D]: Affine N-scheme
  [D]: fpqc topology
  [D]: Category/site of Affine N-schemes and the topos of sheaves on them

  [D]: Totally split morphisms (totally split functor)
  [D]: Connected in terms of idempotents (refer also to topos theoretic definition below)
  [L]: Maps between totally splits, and idempotent decompositions (Key lemma)

  [D]: Locally trivial schemes i.e. Finite etale morphisms. They form a category.
  [T]: Agrees with "usual" definition for rings (Agrees with usual definition modulo choice of topology)
  [E]: Booleans are simply connected

  [D]: Geometric point
  [E]: Separably closed fields and Booleans

  [R]: Finite etale schemes form a stack in the fpqc topology. This allows one to define
  	finite etale for more base sheaves


Section 3: Galois Category

  [D]: Define Galois with Grothendieck's axioms.
  [T]: FEtx satisfies A1-A4(?), even if disconnected
  [T]: Pull back from FEtx to point is exact and reflects isomorphisms (if connected) A5-A6
  [C]: FEtx is a Galois category (under the correct assumptions).

  [R]: Agrees with usual etale fundamental group for rings
  [R]: Compare this theory to Artin-Galois theory (move this?)

  [E]: \pi_1(Booleans)=0


Section 4: Complemntary points of view

  [R]: Fundamental groups in abstract topos theory (SGA4/Johnstone/Moerdijk)
  	 	Comparison of definitions of connectedness
		Alternative definition in Johnstone: Boolean Topos + exact/refl functor
		Boolean topos (even if disconnected)
  [R]: (Co)monadic point of view? Multiple base points?


Section 5: Arithmetic examples

  [T]: R_+ are simply connected
  [T]: For each real point p E_p,+ and E_++ are simply connected (E a number field)
  [T]: Natural numbers are simply connected


Section 6: Jim's Etale Quadratic Extensions

  [R]: Motivation from group actions on plane.
        Obivious diagonal definition doesn't work.
        Follow nose to get "poor man's" diagonal.
        Result has B point, therefore not a ring.
        No idempotents, so connected.
  [T]: R above is **not** simply connected


Later topics?
	Moduli space of (free) quadratic extensions
	Generalize this to degree n?
	What about non-free?
